# Simon Says

Simon Says is a desktop application that emulates the classic memory game where players must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. 
Built using C++ and the Qt framework, this project showcases a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate game logic from the user interface.

## 🎮 Features
- Interactive GUI with colored buttons representing game inputs
- Audio feedback for each button press using .wav sound files
- Randomized color sequences that increase in length with each round
- MVC design pattern for clean separation of concerns
- Built with Qt 6.8.2 and MinGW 64-bit toolchain

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++: Core programming language
- Qt Framework: For GUI components and application structure
- QMake: Build system (Simon-Says.pro project file)
- WAV Audio Files: For button sound effects
